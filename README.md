## Introduction:
Udemy is an American educational platform for open online courses that professional adults and students can take. It was founded in May 2010. it Contains many categorical fields, such as development, design, business, technology, and marketing.
June of 2021, the platform has more than 44 million students, 183,000 courses, and 65,000 instructors teaching courses in 75 languages. There have been over 594 million course enrollments.


## 	Motivation:

By using Udemy online courses dataset, we will be able to predict best course Rating based on the features that we have.


## 	Dataset:

The dataset that we will be using for our prediction is taken form Kaggle.
Below is the list of features we will be using:


Course ID	The course ID of a particular course
Course Title	Shows the unique names of the courses available under the
Enrollment	The cumulative number of students in the course

Price Currency	The currency corresponding to the price detail amount for a course


## 	Tools
	Beautiful soup library: will be used to parse the HTML data
	Selenium library: will be used as a driver for site navigation
	A linear regression model for data modeling
	Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

## 	MVP Goal:
The MVP goal of this project is a linear regression model by using different features of development and marketing
